## Question 1: What is your developer journey so far? What brought you to this major, and why did you take this class?

As it regards my journey as a developer I was able to take CIS 475, which was, for me, an introduction to HTML code and formatting. I was brought to the major of Information Systems by my desire to be able to design and maintain a system that can benfit those of society. Seeing that all technological innovations revolve around a system I believe that understanding the current systems that already in place will allow for a greater degree of understanding in predicting future innovations. I am taking this class primarily because it is a requirement for the completion of my major.   

However outside of this I have always had a deep interest in the web and the behind-the-scenes work that goes into creating dynamic web designs. I hope that is one aspect I am able to learn from this class.

## Question 2: What is your ideal career progression, if there were no limitations?

My ideal career would be one where I am at the center of banking and finance. Even though my major is in Information Systems I have always had a desire to integrate this into banking. I believe that at the center of each financial institution is a system that is a ble to keep track of each and every one of its current and prospective customers. Without limitations a career where I am able to put banking, finance and informations systems together is ideal for me. I believe a lack of this transparency is what has been the cause of so mamny data breaches that have leaked the financial information of so many customers. Ultimately banking and information systems have much to do with one another and cannot truly be seperated.

## Question 3: What programming experience do you have? Do you have any web experience?

In terms of programming expereince I do have extensive experience in Java, C++, COBOL and Netbeans. In a previous class I was able to code a car rental program where users were able to rent vehicles from either a private shop or a corporate shop. Afterwhich a user could choose from the list of available cars based on makes and models. As it regards web experience, I do have experience with HTML code creation from scratch as well as editting. In a previous class I was able to design a website which ranked the top 5 smartphones of 2018 based on their respective price, specifications and popularity. The website was in no means perfect, but it did accomplish its goals that were set from the beginning.
